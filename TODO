- Notify players when pods are determined.
- Add a player after an event has started.
- Use POST not GET for write actions (start event, etc.)
- Creating pods and starting event should be a transaction.
- Does profile linking work? It doesn't for my id.
- Starting an event with 0 people leads to an error but we don't really care.
- The whole row should be a link?
- You can't drop if you have an outstanding result
- Ability to undo/go back and re-pair, etc.
- Checking for admin/required params/etc. should be in Page or similar
- db is returning strings for COUNT(*) in awaitingPairings which is bad.
- Do all db failures throw exceptions or is it possible to have silent failure?
  More checking of return values?
- Drop button appears too much and doesn't work in all contexts
- Pod page before pairings should show players in pod
- "Your outstanding result" front and center and on every page
- Opponent profile pic not using profilepic is gross
- Some way to end event
- Standings on pod page
- Rationalize event/pod -- event should just be a holding pen really - pod is where the acton happens
- It's a bit fragile that player/opponent has a stable ordering that we rely on.
- Throw an IllegalStateException in pod if we try to load a pod id that doesn't exist, and catch in pod/index.

=Known Bugs

=Features
- Notify players when pods are determined.
- Add a player after an event has started.
- Ability to undo/go back and re-pair, etc.
- "Your outstanding result" front and center and on every page
- Standings on pod page
- Time rounds (50 min timer - starts when round is paired? "pair all pods" button? "pair all events" button?)
- Admin status should tell them everything that needs doing (event starting, round pairings, outstanding results, maybe something to do with dropping, time on the rounds)

=Improvements
- Pod page after event starts but before pairings should show players/seating of pod but is just blank
- Rationalize event/pod -- event should just be a holding pen really - pod is where the acton happens
- Alignment on pod page is gross, as is inline form.
- Inclination of admin on pod page is to fill in multiple results but that is not respected.
- Some way to drop players from pod page not just event page? Or rationalize event + pod completely so they are the same thing.
- If you drop, award your current match to your opponent 1-0.
- Persist sign in.
- Consistent widths in tables.

=Internal
- Use POST not GET for write actions (start event, etc.)
- Checking for admin/required params/etc. should be in Page or a trait or something similar
- db code is returning strings for COUNT(*) in awaitingPairings which is bad.
- Opponent profile pic not using profilepic is gross
- Throw an IllegalStateException in pod if we try to load a pod id that doesn't exist, and catch in pod/index.
- It's surely possible to avoid the firstRound/subsequentRound thing in Pod.
- Combine name and profilepic if possible
- Separate dir for partials if there are going to be a bunch.
- We load jQuery but we don't use it.

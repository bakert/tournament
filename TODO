- Notify players when pods are determined.
- Add a player after an event has started.
- Use POST not GET for write actions (start event, etc.)
- Starting an event with 0 people leads to an error but we don't really care.
- The whole row on home page should be a link
- Ability to undo/go back and re-pair, etc.
- Checking for admin/required params/etc. should be in Page or a trait or something similar
- db code is returning strings for COUNT(*) in awaitingPairings which is bad.
- Drop button appears too much and doesn't work in all contexts
- Pod page after event starts but before pairings should show players/seating of pod but is just blank
- "Your outstanding result" front and center and on every page
- Opponent profile pic not using profilepic is gross
- Standings on pod page
- Rationalize event/pod -- event should just be a holding pen really - pod is where the acton happens
- Throw an IllegalStateException in pod if we try to load a pod id that doesn't exist, and catch in pod/index.
- It's surely possible to avoid the firstRound/subsequentRound thing in Pod.
- Alignment on pod page is gross, as is inline form.
- Inclination of admin on pod page is to fill in multiple results but that is not respected.
- Stale page should probably not be able to overwrite existing result, or perhaps check it is the same?
- Some way to drop players from pod page not just event page? Or rationalize event + pod completely so they are the same thing.

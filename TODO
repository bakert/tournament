=Known Bugs
- You can sign up for a second event after your first event starts. Is this a bug? This is particularly relevant because dropping from the second event also drops you from the in-progress event right now. So fix one thing or the other.
- Getting the bye a second time and playing someone you have played before are rated the same but it's actually worse to have the bye a second time, I think? More of a theoretical bug than practical.

=Features
- Notify players when pods are determined.
- Add a player after an event has started.
- Ability to undo/go back and re-pair, etc.
- Time rounds (50 min timer - starts when round is paired? "pair all pods" button? "pair all events" button?)
- Admin status should tell them everything that needs doing (event starting, round pairings, outstanding results, maybe something to do with dropping, time on the rounds)
- Past events - show results.
- DCI number - store them and ask anyone new who signs up if they have one
- Store "recently seen" people globally and warn the admin when starting an event if someone recently seen is not signed up for an event.

=Improvements
- Pod page after event starts but before pairings should show players/seating of pod but is just blank
- Rationalize event/pod -- event should just be a holding pen really - pod is where the acton happens
- Alignment on pod page is gross.
- Some way to drop players from pod page not just event page? Or rationalize event + pod completely so they are the same thing.
- Persist sign in.
- Don't just say "Started" on event page - describe current state of an event.
- Drop button should ask for confirmation.
- Drop button should not be so close to result reporting in status box.
- Result reporting buttons should be bigger.
- Auto-pair R2 and R3 when last result reported.

=Internal
- Use POST not GET for write actions (start event, etc.)
- Checking for admin/required params/etc. should be in Page or a trait or something similar
- db code is returning strings for COUNT(*) in awaitingPairings which is bad.
- Opponent profile pic not using profilepic is gross
- Throw an IllegalStateException in pod if we try to load a pod id that doesn't exist, and catch in pod/index.
- It's surely possible to avoid the firstRound/subsequentRound thing in Pod.
- Combine name and profilepic if possible
- Separate dir for partials if there are going to be a bunch.
- Some consistency about how we handle _GET params being compared to ints.
